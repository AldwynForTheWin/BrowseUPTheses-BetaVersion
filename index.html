<p>Project Title: browseUPtheses </p>

<p>Description 
browseUPtheses is an online search engine and a comprehensive portal to 
thousands of published student theses in the University of the Philippines Cebu. 
With its various search filters (e.g. publication by date, department, author, etc.), 
UP students and teachers can acquire full reference of the theses' abstracts so 
they can think of maybe not duplicating or maybe enhancing much more a 
specific scope/field of topic of the theses that is already published by the 
previous students in the University. Moreover, to feel very confident of creating a 
novel scope for theses, you must refer first to this engine to somehow verify that 
you're into a unique venture of writing the most crucial paper you'll ever make 
before graduating in UP – the thesis. </p>

<p>Objectives </p>

<p>The objectives of the application are: 
1. To enable easy access and to keep track of students' research papers

3. To serve as a guide/reference for students in conducting future research 
papers. </p>

<p>Web App Requirements </p>
