Moreover, to feel very confident of creating a \r\nnovel scope for theses, you must refer first to this engine to somehow verify that \r\nyou're into a unique venture of writing the most crucial paper you'll ever make \r\nbefore graduating in UP – the thesis. \r\n \r\nObjectives \r\n \r\nThe objectives of the application are: \r\n1. To enable easy access and to keep track of students' research papers \r\nand scholarly outputs. \r\n2. To provide an organized search engine for convenient retrieval of data. \r\n3.
